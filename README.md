# Model predictive control
MPC course at Chalmers

HA4 leaves blank, actually, I passed this course by attending the non-mandatory exam and got 4/5.

From the homework I understood and applied those methods of RHC, LQ problem, Set point control, Optimization control(basic part), Explicit MPC, stability of MPC, and feasibility synthesis.

DO NOT PLAGIARIZE THE CODES AND ANSWER, OR YOU WILL GET 3/5.
Since the grade stand for getting 5 is nearly impossible under the strict homework-checking standard, the only advice from me for those Chalmers students is if you are confident you can skip all homework and attend the exam :)
